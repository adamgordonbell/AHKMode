* Idea:

** use autohotkey to make "modes" or as keyboard firmware calls them layers

** Modes have an entry method, an exit method, and mapping for all the keys in that mode

** Modes

*** Sticky Shift
entry - shift
exit - after any keypress
mapping = shift + key
*** Caps Word
entry - shift shift
exit - space
mapping - shift + key

*** camelcase
entry -
exit - enter
*** 
***
